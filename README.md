# DAMS
Who are We?
The Disaster Assisstance Management System was developed by three Computer Science students; Oliver Rush, Toby Northrup and Jordan Ramey who currently are attending the University Of Iowa.

# Project Scope:
Saving a life is a noble cause. Natural diasters like COVID-19, floods, earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes can happen unexpectandly and can claim many people lively hoods. Events like this can endanger peoples homes, pets, and assets. No matter your situation our virtual disaster assistance program can help connect you to those in need and those who are willing to help. The system will consist of three seperate roles; an admin, a donor, and a Recipient. Descriptions for each of these roles is outlined below.

# Admin:
Our admin role is reserved for those who do not have disposables on hand but would still like to voulunteer and offer a helping hand. With this role, you will be able to manually match a donor-recipient pair, as well as create events for potential and occuring disaster hotspots.

# Donor:
Our donor is for good samaeitans who are keen to help. You may not be sure what is required to help assist those in need and where the need is located. With this role you will be able to search for requested items and pledge a donation in response. Any help you can offer will go along way in anothers recovery.

# Recipient:
Our recipient role is for those affected by natures fury. Those who are in need of assistance will be able to find pledged resources such as; food, clothing, shelter, medicines, medical help, and various common consoumables. Anyone who has this role will also be able to submit request based on thier current needs for a donor to fufill.
